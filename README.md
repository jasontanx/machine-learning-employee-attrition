# Introduction
## Why is employee attrition an issue?
- High turnover rates / employee attrition are becoming a huge issue for organisations
- The Great Attrition --> [Click here for more information about The Great Attrition](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-great-attrition-is-making-hiring-harder-are-you-searching-the-right-talent-pools)
- High cost of hiring + training + time-taken for recruitment & onboarding

## What is the problem statement of the project?
- Challenges for organisations to retain their current workforce
- Lack of reliable machine learning tools to predict employee attrition

## Aims & Objectives (What do I aim to achive?) 🌟
**The Aims**
- The overall aim of this project is to build a predictive machine learning model that would play a vital part in HRM by accurately predicting employee attrition

**The Objectives**
- To obtain employee attrition dataset with more observations as compared with previous work
- To identify the key features that could affect prediction of employee attrition
- To build a model (and evaluate model performance) that could accurately predict employee attrition
